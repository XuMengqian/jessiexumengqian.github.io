<u><b>For Val, Musician Is the Best Profession in the World</b></u></font></h3>

<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a"> Val, a cello player from Latvia, gives his performance every weekend on the over-bridge near the Metro Station of Hung Hom. He is a student from the university of Arts, Blemen in Germany. He comes to Hong Kong as a tourist and has already been here for two months. He considers playing on the over-bridge normally as practicing skills. He says if lucky, he can get the donation enough to buy a drink.</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a"> Born in a family of musicians, Val plays instruments since eight. His sister Sonya is a musician and model working in Hong Kong. The families think musician is the best profession in the world. He says that it's safe and you don't hurt yourself or others. Val now is studying to get the bachelor degree and he has a big plan to get a doctor degree. Since he has not graduated and become famous, he gets all the financial support from his family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a"> He says Hong Kong is a really good city. People are all friendly to him and the climate is warmer and better for his health. He tells me that Musicians in Hong Kong try to make a law that itâ€™s OK to take donation and he thinks he has more freedom to play here. He also mentions that musician should also be good at marketing. If no one knows about you, no one will pay you. He has booked some concerts to play this year. He says right now, Hong Kong is the best place for him to stay.</font></p>
