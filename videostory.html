   Followed by volunteers, social group members, media and reporters, Chan Cheuk-Ming and his team, pushed the trolleys to give out free food to the homeless people under the overpass in Sham Shui Po on every Saturday evening.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a">Chan Cheuk-Ming is the boss of Peihoc Restaurant and has been doing the charity of giving out food since 2011. He is known by most people because he became the top of the "10 Positive Energy Delegates" elected by Hong Kong citizens in 2013. Till now, over 100 media organizations have reported about him, which all shape him as "the hero for the poor" or "the most handsome man in Hong Kong" People all call him as "Brother Ming".</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a">"If you keep low-key, no one knows what you are doing." He said. He admitted that he was under bigger pressure because his charity team became bigger. He wanted to influence more people and raise more fund through the power of media. He also mentioned that the government hasn't given any help so far.</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a">In fact, facing the crisis of closing down, Peihoc Restaurant was saved by media in 2011 when a magazine ordered meals and gave out to the poor people. Media's exposure made him famous and boomed his business. Brother Ming was grateful and decided to start the charity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Candara" size="3" color="#24a97a">Now, he has kept giving out food on every Saturday for more than five years. His dream is to open many Peihoc Restaurants and send food to the poor people in every district in Hong Kong. </font></p>
